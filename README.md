# ChatGPT CLI

This is the laziest code ever created for a CLI using python and the new `gpt-3.5-turbo` api with some markdown highlighter.

## Instructions

- Clone this repository
- Install the lib locally w/ `pip install -e .` (maybe I'll add a github workflow to publish this at some point)
- Add your API key to env var `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or add to your profile e.g. `vim ~/.zshrc`)
- Call `gpt-cli`
